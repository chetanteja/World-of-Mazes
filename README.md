## A Maze Generation Algorithm in C++ using Prim's Algorithm

## A Maze solver in C++ using DFS

I have used Prim's Algo and specifically used DFS for solving it since Prims Algo tends to make
shorter paths and hence DFS for solving does efficiently better compared to BFS,Dijkistra and A* algos.

Please visit the INFO folder to get a clear idea about the implementation and example outputs

I shall soon be uploading the solver using other algos as well


Also Maze Generator can also be implemented using other algorithms as Randomised DFS (backtracking), Wilson's algo, Kruskal's algorithm which I shall soon be posting as well

### Thank You
