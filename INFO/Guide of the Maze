The starting point is represented by a 'S' and end point as 'E'

The walls of the maze are represented as '#' whereas the path through which we could move would be the gaps or spaces--> " "


The path thorugh which the Algorithm solves the path is represented through the '+' symbol


Each time the code runs gives 2 graphs as Maze in which the first one represents the Maze generated using Prim's Algorithm 
and the second one represents one of the path through which we can move from Start to the End

Also note that the size of the graph can be varied by just changing the value of N

This Solution or path is generated using the Depth-First-Search Algorithm

The Path is represented by the + signs
The walls by #
The gaps by spaces
