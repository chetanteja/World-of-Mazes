## A Maze Generation Algorithm in C++ using Prim's Algorithm

## A Maze solver in C++ using DFS

I have used Prim's Algo and specifically used DFS for solving it since Prims Algo tends to make
shorter paths and hence DFS for solving does efficiently better compared to BFS,Dijkistra and A* algos.

I shall soon be uploading the solver using other algos as well
